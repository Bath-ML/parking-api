# Parking API

This is the API that clients should hit (rather than the h2o model model directly).

## Requirements

Java 8

## Preparation

TODO(not required yet): Run the [h2o model service](https://github.com/bath-ml/h2o-api).

The model currently only returns dummy data.

## Running the server

Run the following in the root of the project:

```
./gradlew bootRun
```

## Stop the server
Do `ctrl+c` in the command line window where this server is running.
